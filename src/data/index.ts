  bio: `I'm a passionate AI Engineer and Data Scientist with a growing track record in developing innovative machine learning and deep learning solutions. My work spans areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, with a strong focus on building AI systems that address real-world challenges.

With a solid academic background and hands-on experience, I've contributed to projects involving data-driven decision-making, model deployment, and end-to-end AI pipelines. In just one year, I've had the opportunity to work on impactful projects and continuously sharpen my skills in both research and practical implementation.

I approach AI development with a blend of curiosity, creativity, and responsibility â€” aiming to build solutions that are not only effective but also ethical and interpretable. I'm especially passionate about using AI for positive impact in fields like healthcare, climate, and education. When I'm not working with data, I enjoy hiking, playing piano, and diving into the latest breakthroughs in tech and science.`,
